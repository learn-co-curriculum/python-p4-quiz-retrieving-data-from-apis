# Using .each

We have a variable `lunch_menu`, set equal to an array of lunch menu items:

```rb
lunch_menu = ["pizza", "sandwich", "sushi", "soup", "salad"]
```

Since you're super hungry and super excited about lunch, use the `.each` method
to enumerate over the array and output a string to the terminal with each lunch
menu item with an `"!"` at the end.

Which piece of code will achieve the desired result? Select all that apply:

## Correct

```rb
lunch_menu.each do |lunch_item|
  puts lunch_item + "!"
end
```

> Correct! Using `each` lets us access each element of the array in the block,
> and we can output a string by using `puts`.

## Incorrect

```rb
puts lunch_menu + "!"
```

> This code would result in an error, since `lunch_menu` is an array, and we
> can't us the `+` method to add a string to the array. How can we iterate over
> each element?

## Correct

```rb
lunch_menu.each do |lunch_item|
  puts "#{lunch_item}!"
end
```

> Correct! Using `each` lets us access each element of the array in the block,
> and we can output a string by using `puts`.

## Incorrect

```rb
lunch_menu.each do |lunch_item|
  "#{lunch_item}!"
end
```

> Using `each` lets us access each element of the array in the block, but this
> method doesn't output anything to the terminal since we aren't using `puts`.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
