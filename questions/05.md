# Object Inheritance: Modules

```rb
module Talk
  module Phrases
    def hello
      "Hello!"
    end

    def goodbye
      "Good bye!"
    end
  end

  module Teachers
    def teach
      "Repeat after me."
    end
  end
end
```

The code sample above is an example of [a1] modules. To access the `Teachers`
module to include it in a class, we would type include [a2].

## Correct

- namespaced
- a1

> Correct! Both `Teachers` and `Phrases` are namespaced inside of `Talk`. They
> can be accessed using `::`.

## Incorrect

- subclass inherited
- a1

> There aren't any classes, nor any subclass inheritance, in the syntax above.
> You might want to review the resource/s for this question.

## Incorrect

- I don't know
- a1

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.

## Correct

- Talk::Teachers
- a2

> Correct! To `include` the `Teachers` module, we need to access it using `::`
> on the module that contains it.

## Incorrect

- Teachers::Talk
- a2

> When using `::` to access a nested module, we put the module that contains the
> other module on the left side of the double colon.

## Incorrect

- Talk.Teachers
- a2

> Not quite. This looks more like we're trying to call a method on `Talk`.
